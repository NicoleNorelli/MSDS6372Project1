## Automible MSRP Analysis and Prediction

#### Objecive 1
We are trying to analyse the importance of the "Popularity" variable. While the details of this variable is vague, it was created from social media, and the "higher ups" are curious how much general popularity can play a role in the retail price of a vehicle.

**Data Import and Cleaning...**
```{r dataINC}
library(tidyverse)
# You need to adjust the work environment to run this code
setwd("/Users/mingyang/Desktop/SMU/Applied Statistics/MSDS6372Project1")
# Read in data under variable CarData
CarData = read.csv("data1.csv")
# Fixing three empty values in CarData$Engine.Fuel.Type, after research they are regular unleaded
CarData$Engine.Fuel.Type = ifelse(CarData$Engine.Fuel.Type=="","regular unleaded",CarData$Engine.Fuel.Type)
# Fixing Mazda RX model Engine Cylinders to 0
CarData$Engine.Cylinders = ifelse(CarData$Make=="Mazda"&is.na(CarData$Engine.Cylinders),0,CarData$Engine.Cylinders)
# Check the reading - can later be deleted
head(CarData)
str(CarData)
dim(CarData)
# Convert factor variables
variables.to.factor = c("Make","Model","Engine.Fuel.Type","Transmission.Type","Driven_Wheels","Market.Category","Vehicle.Size","Vehicle.Style")
CarData[variables.to.factor] = lapply(CarData[variables.to.factor],factor)
# Look at summary of data
summary(CarData)
summary(CarData$Market.Category)

missingData = CarData[rowSums(is.na(CarData)) > 0,]
missingData
dim(missingData)
