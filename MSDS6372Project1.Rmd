#### Objecive 1
We are trying to analyse the importance of the "Popularity" variable. While the details of this variable is vague, it was created from social media, and the "higher ups" are curious how much general popularity can play a role in the retail price of a vehicle.

This model need to be highly interpretable. We need to provide interpretation of the regression coefficients of the final model including hypothesis testing, interpretation of regression coefficients, and confidence intervals.

```{r}
# Explore numerical variables
train %>% select(MSRP,Year,EngineHP,EngineCylinders,NumberOfDoors,HighwayMPG,CityMPG,Popularity)%>%ggpairs()
# Try Log transformation on MSRP see if it will improve correlations
train$logMSRP = log(train$MSRP)
train %>% select(logMSRP,Year,EngineHP,EngineCylinders,NumberOfDoors,HighwayMPG,CityMPG,Popularity)%>%ggpairs()
# It looks like logMSRP has increased correlation with Year but decreased correlation with EngineHP, EngineCylinders
# It's best to run LASSO and choose predictors on both with transformation and without Log transformation in order to identify which
# Model performs better
